;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Navigate read-only buffer like vi behavior.
;;
;; I like Emacs' default keystroke, which is easy to use.
;; I prefer use vi style keystroke if current buffer is read-only
;; that we can quickly navigated with one key press.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put vi-navigate.el to your load-path.
;; The load-path is usually ~/elisp/.
;; It's set in your ~/.emacs like this:
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;;
;; And the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'vi-navigate)
;; (vi-navigate-load-keys)
;;

;;; Customize:
;;
;; `vi-navigate-key-alist'
;; `vi-navigate-sdcv-key-alist'
;; `vi-navigate-help-mode-key-alist'
;; `vi-navigate-hook-list'
;;
;; All of the above can customize by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET vi-navigate RET
;;

;;; Change log:
